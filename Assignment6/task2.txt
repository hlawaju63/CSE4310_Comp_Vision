Using average_face.png we get the following results
tp = 29
fp = 562
fn = 17

while using average_face_cropped.png we get the following results
tp = 28
fp = 110
fn = 16

Although, both true positive and false negatives are similar while using two different 
images as reference for face detection with only a number difference between both values,
there's a wide difference in the value that we get in false positive. There were 562, false
positives using average_face.png while only 110 using average_face_cropped.png. This means
there were many detection in dataset that didnot correspond to actual locations of object of
interest when using average_face.png. So average_face_cropped.png is better option.
Also the ratio of false positive over gorund truth from is much better for second image than
thaat of first image.
